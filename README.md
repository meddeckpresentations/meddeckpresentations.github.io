# meddeckpresentations.github.io

This repository contains the static support and documentation landing site for MedDeck. It is published via GitHub Pages at https://meddeckpresentations.github.io.

Contents:
- `index.html` — landing page with support, docs links and contact form (mailto-based fallback).
- `styles.css` — site styling.

What I used from the app repo:
- Links to the source repository: https://github.com/alionpax/meddeck
- An optional preview image is referenced at `assets/preview.png` in the app repo branch `checkpoint/stable-viewer`. If the image is present it will show on the hero; otherwise a fallback mockup displays.

How to edit
1. Clone this repo
2. Update `index.html` and `styles.css` as needed
3. Push to `main`; GitHub Pages serves the site from `main` by default for a user site.
